# Introduction
The introduction section of this documentation serves to teach new users the information that they need to be able to make their own modpacks with KubeJS. The information found in this section is not fully comprehensive (I.E. not every single recipe event will be covered, etc), instead focusing on teaching users so they are able to read the rest of the documentation, and be able to apply it. 

However, that doesn't mean what is found here is lacking, quite the opposite. In fact, those looking to simply add a recipe or two with KubeJS (wanting an eltyra recipe for that SMP?) will only need to read the first two pages! 

Regardless of what you are here for, thanks for reading! Those looking to contribute can refer back to the home page for more information.
